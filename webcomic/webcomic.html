    Alright, looks like I finally got the ball rolling. This is the first time I'm doing anything of this scale, and while I'm not completely confident in my current skills
    as a writer and an artist, I figured it's better to start on something so I could get a feel for it. Expect some early installment weirdness.

    I'd also like to bring up for what may be the 50th time for some of you that this won't be a porn-centric series. I'm not saying I'm planning on making it completely
    PG or anything, just don't want people getting blue balled. ALSO, this comic is read from left to right. You have been warned.
