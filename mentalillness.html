What does it mean for me to be a furry?
<br><br>
Sounds like a very trivial question in the grand scheme of things, doesn't it? I mean, who actually cares whether you're interested in silly cartoon animals or not? Why should it matter that you happen to like anthropomorphic dogs?
<br><br>
Let me begin by sharing how I got involved in all this. Growing up, I actually expressed very little interest in the typical gateways furries pinpoint as their first ventures into the fandom. Robin Hood? It was okay, but not very memorable. Lion King? I enjoyed it. Nothing more. Balto? What's that? I can say that I was a huge fan of Sonic the Hedgehog at a very young age, but I hadn't the faintest urge to think of it as anything more than a great series. Sure, six-year-old me would run around the playground with my arms clenched to my sides pretending to be as fast as the blue blur, but in terms of how I view the greater cast and OCs, I just had virtually zero interest. In fact, I stopped caring about Sonic after elementary school since the 'Dark Age' of the franchise, but that's a topic for another day. I'm not trying to act all 'holier-than-thou' or anything, just detailing my early brushings with "furry media."
<br><br>
So what started all this? Funny enough, I first developed an interest when I watched Zootopia with a friend of mine at the age of... 20? 21? At this time, it was a couple years after I dropped out of college a second time, and I spent most of my time lying in bed stewing in my own depressive filth. Regardless, I was absolutely captivated by it. My friend even told me that he thought I didn't like it because I wasn't saying anything until the end. Despite that, I didn't exactly look into the Zootopia community, fanart, or anything. I'm not sure why to this day, but I think it's because I just didn't care too much about Nick or Judy.
<br><br>
That's when I got into a visual novel called Morenatsu. I'd imagine if you have similar interests as me, you would be very familiar with this, but for the uninitiated, it's a gay visual novel involving furries of all backgrounds and body types set in a rural Japanese town. I came in with zero expectations and found myself completely immersed in a world of beloved characters and stories. Despite it having sexual scenes, most of the content is genuine interactions with others and sharing their struggles/triumphs. Funny enough, the character who I thought I was going to enjoy the most since he closely matched my type ended up being my least favorite, simply due to how his route was written. I even tried the routes of characters I didn't care for at first just to get the full experience and was pleasantly surprised by how much I actually enjoyed them. I felt a surging passion within me, one I hadn't felt within five years dulled with severe depression. It was a very visceral feeling, almost frightening even, but it kept bouncing around within me to the point where I knew I had to do something about it. So I got out a pencil and a piece of paper and started drawing. And kept drawing. And couldn't stop drawing. By this point, my pencil was gliding across the paper channeling my newfound vigor almost as if my love for drawing never went away. Tears were pouring from my eyes as I indulged in a spark I thought I had lost. I knew I had found something to propel me forward in life.

<div style="font-size:10px; text-align:center;"><i>First furry drawing. Wow!</i></div>

<p>
<br><br>
From there, I looked into furry communities, started looking for furry art, the whole 9 yards. It felt like an entirely new territory to explore. Funny enough, I geniunely started out by trying to draw racy content because that's what everyone else wanted/was drawing. However, I could never quite get into it, and after a certain point, I realized that I didn't have to draw anthro folks performing lascivious gestures. I could draw what was meaningful to me. However, I find myself not enjoying what's considered tasteful furry art, at least what I could find on sites like Reddit's furry subreddit. Part of it is because I personally don't like how, to put it bluntly, a lot of modern westerners tend to stylize furries, and how most of the people within the community exhibit some very peculiar behaviors. For instance, I find a lot of conversations having a very 'cutesy,' almost affectionate tone to them, almost as if they're acting through the idea of being an anthropomorphic creature. This in conjunction to the idea of having a 'fursona' did not resonate well with me at all, and I find myself out of place with the likes of these people. Sometimes I wonder if my reaction stems from some sort of self-hatred about being a furry, but I genuinely feel disgust whenever I witness this bizarre child-like behavior within the fandom. It seems to be near-universal as well, and it makes me wonder how these people behave outside the fandom and whether there's some link to neurodivergence and being involved in the fandom, but that's something I cannot dwell on much since there's so little information about it out there.
<br><br>
And yet, I still feel strongly associated with the idea of anthropomorphic animals. Wolf anthros, specifically. I sincerely wish I could describe in words just what they mean to me, but I lack the vocabulary for it. The closest I could say is that it fills my heart with joy knowing that I can at least have drawings of them around me, and that I constantly pine over whether I'd be able to see them in the afterlife. Yes, I know that's a very twisted way of viewing it, but that's sincerely the best way I can put it in words. With that in mind, I ventured out to converse with like-minded people. However, I find myself largely an outcast because of how differently I behave compared to the average furry. And believe me, I have tried a number of times to mingle with groups of them, only to ostracize myself because of how differently I see anthros (spoiler alert: a lot of them center around porn or roleplaying, usually both). I have made genuine attempts to find people who mainly see furry as a creative outlet, and more, without mainly focusing on porn, but not only are they few and far between, the ones I do find don't share the very specific kind of furries I like. Don't get me wrong, of course I'm going to have to make compromises in that department, and I cherish the relationships I have with them, but it feels lonesome being one of the very few people out there sharing similar views. Again, perhaps it's a product of some kind of self-hated I cannot pinpoint, but we'll see how things turn out in the future. I would like to reiterate that I'm not trying to sound like I'm superior to anyone or anything; if anything, my experiences left me deprived of any meaningful connections with people of shared passions.

How much does sexuality play a role in this? For starters, I personally have a difficult time indulging in sexual fantasies involving anthros. At best, they help get it up, but it honestly doesn't feel as engaging as situations involving real-life humans. As a matter of fact, I find myself blocking most pornography involving anthros because I find the large majority of it repulsive. That being said, to say that sexuality doesn't play a role in how I view furries would be a lie. Not only do I only draw male furries, but I tend to stick to a very narrow set of body types. Beyond that, however, is where the line gets blurred. Despite mainly drawing muscular frames, I actually find the idea of bodybuilders quite repulsive, to the point where I physically recoil whenever I see an image of one. So why do I keep drawing it, you may ask? It's hard to put it into words, and again is why I'm still confused about how sexuality plays a role in my meddling with anthros, but I genuinely find the idea of muscular anthros very... appealing. Aesthetic, even. And it resonates with me on a deeper level than I can explain properly, almost like it's some unattainable beauty. You're probably thinking by now that I've really gone off my rocker and that I should just accept that it's just jack-off material, and I completely understand. I mean, what differenciates platonic and sexual appeal when it comes to a subject constantly subjected to perversion? But I digress. In the end, I indulge in what I enjoy, even if it doesn't make any sense to me. I mean, for all I know, this could all just be a product of my current mental wellbeing (which is currently quite poor), and all of it will just dissipate once I adopt a better lifestyle. Or I could just be in the thick of strong denial and will embrace a lifestyle full of furry porn and fursuiting. I bring this up because a lot of the situations I imagine involving furries just happen to be situations I long for in general, such as spending time at a carnival or camping out with a loved one under the glistening stars. Then again, I don't think my... love... for anthro animals will just poof away, and that it's something that resides much deeper within me. And I don't use that L-word lightly.
<br><br>
It's hard to say where I'd be if I didn't find my love for furries. Would I still be drawing? Would I find purpose in life? This is difficult for me to think about because I honestly ascribe a lot of my positive changes with the catalyst that is my discovery of anthros. I wasn't exposed to much media growing up, and I was wrought with depression and anxiety to the point where I had virtually zero passion in anything.

<i>What the fuck, David. Why did you bother writing this page?</i>
<br><br>
I don't know. Call it a therapeutic exercise. In all sincerity, this has been something I've been struggling with for the past few years now. Who knows, maybe it'll all resolve itself sooner or later, but for now, it's eating up a decent portion of my sad life.
<br><br>
  
  There's more I'll be adding and proofreading but this is basically just something I'm putting out for now.
