    You don't miss old DeviantArt.
<br><br>
You miss the days before the Internet was largely privatized and corporatized.
<br><br>
You miss the days when the Internet was like the Wild West, where anyone could post anything and you wouldn't have to worry about someone's very minor and largely inconsequential faux pas making national news within an hour.
<br><br>
You miss the days when you didn't have to pay rent, when you didn't have to work two jobs and still struggle to live paycheque to paycheque.
<br><br>
You miss the days when your art was actually valued by the people who saw it, when people still interacted through more than just retweets and like buttons, when people shared it because they genuinely enjoyed it and not because they were looking for fake Internet points.
<br><br>
You miss the days when your work could be widely received and become popular because it was good, not because it had to intentionally manipulate an algorithm or hashtag promotion or unintentionally get lucky.
<br><br>
You miss the days when your work and its value was recognized for your skill, message, and passion, not for its follow count and how digestible and attention-grabbing it is by collective society at large.
<br><br>
You miss the days when people could pay attention to something for more than 30 seconds and actually discuss its meaning, what it brought to the table, and have even an inch of critical thought.
<br><br>
You miss the days when you could do your art because you wanted to, because you had real freedom, not to satisfy a third party or some imaginary expectation imposed upon you by society, because what you drew was for you and no one else.
<br><br>
You miss the days when context mattered, when people were intelligent enough to recognize and acknowledge that society's standards are constantly changing, so something created 100 years ago shouldn't be held to the same standards as something created today.
<br><br>
You miss originality and creativity, new ideas being celebrated rather than old ideas being resold to you on the basis of nostalgia.
<br><br><br><br>
You miss your childhood.
