<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>

Hello, my name is David. I am a 2-time college dropout turned hobby hopper. Some of the things I do include:

   </p>

   <p>
<ul>
<li>Digital drawing</li>
<li>3D Modeling</li>
<li>Programming</li>
</ul>
   </p>

   <p>
      By many metrics, I'm still a fledgling in the grand scheme of things, but I'm always shooting high. Hopefully I can reach my goals someday, mainly getting my art skills to a high-end level and being involved in game development projects.
   </p>

Although I'm actually someone who grew up in the 2000s, I find the concept and aesthetic of the old web very captivating. There's something... indescribable about trawling through one's personal Geocities site and getting a glimpse of their creative expression. The idea that one can design how their website will be navigated by a user and fill every nook and cranny with bits and pieces of themself is a lost art in today's sterilized, ad-farming social media sites... but I'm probably just romanticizing what is a very clunky and limited era.

My past? You mean I'm to write about my upbringing and what I'm doing now? Hah! All I can say is they tried to stop me, but I'm back, and stronger than ever now!!
