         <ul>
<li>Male, born in the mid-90&pos;s, American, POC, home of sexual, furry &#40;duh&#41;</li>
<li>CPTSD, ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, just so much anxiety</li>
<li>I love Sonic, MapleStory, random Nintendo games... really love the 2D pixel aesthetic</li>
<li>I have been a NEET for almost 6 years by now, save for the odd job every now and then that hardly lasts longer than a month. I am planning on going back to school to get an associate of general studies degree, though.</li>
<li>I play too much League of Legends. Peaked at about D2 &#40;back when that mattered&#41; but SoloQ really lost its charm after Season 3ish. These days, I just dick around in low elo with friends. Add &pos;Helen Wong&pos; if you&pos;re on NA! </li>

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>

Hello, my name is David. I am a 2-time college dropout turned hobby hopper. Some of the things I do include:

   </p>

   <p>
<ul>
<li>Digital drawing</li>
<li>3D Modeling</li>
<li>Programming</li>
</ul>
   </p>

   <p>
      By many metrics, I'm still a fledgling in the grand scheme of things, but I'm always shooting high. Hopefully I can reach my goals someday, mainly getting my art skills to a high-end level and being involved in game development projects.
   </p>

My past? You mean I'm to write about my upbringing and what I'm doing now? Hah! All I can say is they tried to stop me, but I'm back, and stronger than ever now!!
