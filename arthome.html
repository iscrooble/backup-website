<a href="runnign around.gif"><img src="runnign around.gif" alt="fuck" width="200" title="Sprite WIP I'm making for a game! Ignore the bugs and placeholder frames, but I'm proud of how far it's come along so far. Unfortunately, the framerate here is pretty bad."></a>

<a href="https://i.imgur.com/cf2YXTT.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cf2YXTT.png" alt="fuck" width="400" title="This is my OC, Cyrus! Now in VRChat form! Yikes, even on my own website, I don't feel safe talking about my own creations. I haven't developed much of a backstory for him because my latent cringe energy is too strong, but I wanted to make someone who was both striking and imposing in appearance. I really wish I didn't hate showing him off, but at the very least, running around as him in VRChat gives me some kind of indescribable happiness."></a>

I actually did this a few hours before the deadline, and am quite proud of how it came out. In hindsight, I could push the colors more, but oh well."></a>

  <a href="astro.png"><img src="astro.png" alt="fuck" width="400" title="Somehow, this is my most popular piece on Twitter. Then again, I made this right on the brink of the Among Us craze despite not having the game in mind in the first place. This is actually just a study of a frame from Aliens that I adapted into a subject more to my liking."></a>

  <a href="yeah.png"><img src="yeah.png" alt="fuck" width="400" title="I can confidently say that this is one of my favorite drawings, and even half a year later as I'm writing this, I don't find it too abhorrent to look at. I absolutely love the mood and atmosphere this piece gives and this side to Cyrus; will probably explore this more some other time."></a>

  <a href="temptation.jpg"><img src="temptation.jpg" alt="fuck" width="200" title="I liked this one a lot for a while, but it's definitely aged poorly for me. Which is good because that means I'm improving. Can't go wrong with front-facing portraits, though."></a>

  <a href="guitar.png"><img src="guitar.jpg" alt="fuck" width="200" title="Oh man, this one just looks washed at this point. My therapist suggested that I print and hang one of my drawings, and I chose this one because I figured I wouldn't hate it for a while. Boy, was I wrong. I still can't look at the part of the wall that has this piece hanging. Funny enough, my friend bought a scuffed version of as poster of it for himself, and despite his gushing, I still cannot fathom as to why anyone would like my art that much, let alone hang it up on their wall."></a>

  <a href="katana.png"><img src="katana.png" alt="fuck" width="400" title="Product of a 1-hour(?) drawing challenge with a friend, although it took a bit more than that. I want to play around with both the colors and character some more sometime."></a>

  <a href="gif2.gif"><img src="gif2.gif" alt="fuck" width="400" title="My second attempt at 3D modeling with Blender. Planned on making this into a VRChat avatar until I saw that you had to have 40 hours of active gameplay to even upload a model in the first place. I basically just scrapped him and didn't bother with VRChat or 3D modeling for more than half a year before picking it back up in December 2020."></a>
