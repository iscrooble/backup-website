<a href="test2.png"><img src="test2.png" alt="fuck" width="300px" title="Quick painting test. Lots to learn, lots that have been learned. I don't think I care for full figure drawings as much as portraits, but that's still something I'm grappling to understand about myself. Probably better to not overthink it."></a>
<a href="wings.png"><img src="wings.png" alt="fuck" width="300px" title="(Check inspect element to read the full thing) It's been about 5 months between this drawing and the last. I stopped digital painting mostly because my tablet stopped working, and at that point I was so frustrated with where I was at in terms of my art progress, as you can tell from the tooltip of my previous submission. I started drawing in my sketchbook, and realized that it was actually very enjoyable to just draw for fun. That might sound obvious, but for the most part, I was trying to draw to both impress and one-up myself. I could never just draw for fun because I'd always feel I was wasting time, and that I'd be further behind if I just indulged in doodles and whatnot. So I started doing what I've always loved to do but was afraid to get into: drawing front facing portaits. I drew so many of them and initially got frustrated with how wonky they looked, how I couldn't seem to get them to look right, And then I kept going. And the faces got better. And I loved drawing faces, and I loved drawing my OCs, so I really started to feel like I'm enjoying the final product. Eventually, I stopped feeling that burning desire of wanting to draw faces in the front view, so I moved on to side views. Then three-quarters. Eventually I started to even draw the shoulders and chest. I honestly never realized until then that I could just draw what I wanted to draw instead of drawing for the sake of getting better, and the improvements start to come regardless. And man, did the improvements come in. Drawing in my sketchbook has seriously allowed me to freely play around with structure and values, and I really started to get a grip on form and proportions--things that I normally greatly struggled with. I also had art coaching to alleviate my mental health struggles around art, and while I'm not entirely sold on the efficacy of coaching in general, this particular program has seriously changed my life. My usual insecurities and anguish over art have significantly diminished, and I'm slowly becoming both a better artist and a better person overall. I still have a long road ahead of me, but I can be assured that I'm on the right path now."></a>

<a href="practice.png"><img src="practice.png" alt="fuck" width="400px" title="Every time I draw, I think I capture such a great angle or something, and then I realize that I just did head tilted to the side from above #329. Need to break out of this cycle somehow, yeesh. Not to mention, he's just expressionless as always. Ugh. Also painted this one with a mouse, but at this point I think I'm just going to do all my paintings with a mouse since it feels nicer. I also modified the head and whatnot so much that it looks pretty different from the sketch form. God, I just want to find art to be not panic-inducing. Probably just need to do more studies."></a>

<a href="watercolor1.jpg"><img src="watercolor1.jpg" alt="fuck" width="400px" title="Trying to get the hang of watercolors after putting it off for so long. It's fun but kinda frustrating to work with, at least for now. I've always been in love with the watercolor aesthetic but had always put it off since digital was much more accessible for me growing up. There's something about the texture and how the pigments flow that's difficult to replicate in digital."></a>

<a href="eh.png"><img src="eh.png" alt="fuck" width="400px" title="Going back to my roots, had a shroom  trip the week of making this which had me reevaluate what direction I wanted to go to artistically-speaking. After months of frustration and aimlessness, I really needed this to ground myself. Even took the time to paint this with a mouse, which I find a lot more comfortable and intuitive albeit time-consuming and a bit hard on the wrist."></a>

<a href="eye.png"><img src="eye.png" alt="fuck" width="400" title="Tried going for a more realistic painterly look while minimizing layers/blending modes. Managed to get under 30 layers, so props to me for that. Also just studying different eye makeups because queer. Oh my god, you have no idea how bad my perfectionism was with this one. I practically redid it 3-4 times because I'm honestly just so artistically lost. What style do I want? What kind of rendering is appealing to me? What do I even like anymore? Yeesh, that's a lot for a tooltip. *UPDATE* Well I did a couple eye studies and reoriented my thinking. Progress progress."></a>

Yikes, even on my own website, I don't feel safe talking about my own creations. I haven't developed much of a backstory for him because my latent cringe energy is too strong, but I wanted to make someone who was both striking and imposing in appearance. I really wish I didn't hate showing him off, but at the very least, running around as him in VRChat gives me some kind of indescribable happiness."></a>

My therapist suggested that I print and hang one of my drawings, and I chose this one because I figured I wouldn't hate it for a while. Boy, was I wrong. I still can't look at the part of the wall that has this piece hanging. Funny enough, my friend bought a scuffed version of as poster of it for himself, and despite his gushing, I still cannot fathom as to why anyone would like my art that much, let alone hang it up on their wall."></a>
