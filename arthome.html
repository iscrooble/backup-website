<a href="eh.png"><img src="eh.png" alt="fuck" width="400px" title="Going back to my roots, had a shroom  trip the week of making this which had me reevaluate what direction I wanted to go to artistically-speaking. After months of frustration and aimlessness, I really needed this to ground myself. Even took the time to paint this with a mouse, which I find a lot more comfortable and intuitive albeit time-consuming and a bit hard on the wrist."></a>

<a href="eye.png"><img src="eye.png" alt="fuck" width="400" title="Tried going for a more realistic painterly look while minimizing layers/blending modes. Managed to get under 30 layers, so props to me for that. Also just studying different eye makeups because queer. Oh my god, you have no idea how bad my perfectionism was with this one. I practically redid it 3-4 times because I'm honestly just so artistically lost. What style do I want? What kind of rendering is appealing to me? What do I even like anymore? Yeesh, that's a lot for a tooltip. *UPDATE* Well I did a couple eye studies and reoriented my thinking. Progress progress."></a>

<a href="https://i.imgur.com/cf2YXTT.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cf2YXTT.png" alt="fuck" width="400" title="This is my OC, Cyrus! Now in VRChat form! Yikes, even on my own website, I don't feel safe talking about my own creations. I haven't developed much of a backstory for him because my latent cringe energy is too strong, but I wanted to make someone who was both striking and imposing in appearance. I really wish I didn't hate showing him off, but at the very least, running around as him in VRChat gives me some kind of indescribable happiness."></a>

I actually did this a few hours before the deadline, and am quite proud of how it came out. In hindsight, I could push the colors more, but oh well."></a>

  <a href="astro.png"><img src="astro.png" alt="fuck" width="400" title="Somehow, this is my most popular piece on Twitter. Then again, I made this right on the brink of the Among Us craze despite not having the game in mind in the first place. This is actually just a study of a frame from Aliens that I adapted into a subject more to my liking."></a>

  <a href="yeah.png"><img src="yeah.png" alt="fuck" width="400" title="I can confidently say that this is one of my favorite drawings, and even half a year later as I'm writing this, I don't find it too abhorrent to look at. I absolutely love the mood and atmosphere this piece gives and this side to Cyrus; will probably explore this more some other time."></a>

  <a href="temptation.jpg"><img src="temptation.jpg" alt="fuck" width="200" title="I liked this one a lot for a while, but it's definitely aged poorly for me. Which is good because that means I'm improving. Can't go wrong with front-facing portraits, though."></a>

  <a href="guitar.png"><img src="guitar.jpg" alt="fuck" width="200" title="Oh man, this one just looks washed at this point. My therapist suggested that I print and hang one of my drawings, and I chose this one because I figured I wouldn't hate it for a while. Boy, was I wrong. I still can't look at the part of the wall that has this piece hanging. Funny enough, my friend bought a scuffed version of as poster of it for himself, and despite his gushing, I still cannot fathom as to why anyone would like my art that much, let alone hang it up on their wall."></a>

Planned on making this into a VRChat avatar until I saw that you had to have 40 hours of active gameplay to even upload a model in the first place. I basically just scrapped him and didn't bother with VRChat or 3D modeling for more than half a year before picking it back up in December 2020."></a>
