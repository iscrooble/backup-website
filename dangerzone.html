  Alright, bucko. Seems like you've entered the <span style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Danger Zoneâ„¢</span>. You know what happens here, do you? No? Well, allow me to demonstrate first hand.

<br><br>

<i>BAM! POW!</i>

<br><br>

Heh, get it? First hand? That is, my first hand into your face. This is my territory, and in my territory, <b>*I*</b> make the rules. You've really gone and done it now, haven't you? I can see you quivering in your seat as I speak, too scared to do anything but witness the smackdown upon you.

<br><br>

<i>SOCK! WHAP!</i>

<br><br>

There's no use in resisting now. What's that? I can't understand you with all the blubbering you're making. Should've known better than to mess with me and my turf. Come on now. Get up. We're just getting started here. What's that? You want another taste of my knuckle sandwich? Heh, some kids just never learn, huh.

<br><br>

<i>BOP! KWOCK! SMOOCH!</i>

<br><br>

Hah! Bet you're so confused right now. What's it like being a faggot now, queerboy? Like getting kissed by a MAN?

<br><br>

...What? I'm the homosexual here? Don't be stupid, you're the one who got kissed... I'm the gay one because I started it? T-that's not how it works at all. Stop trying to confuse me!

<br><br>

<i>CLOBBER! SMOOCH! *PULLS YOU IN DEEPER, TONGUE REACHING AROUND*</i>

<br><br>

What? No, I didn't kiss you again. Now you're just making stuff up! Do I have to teach you this lesson again?

<br><br>

..Alright, maybe I got caught in the heat of the moment, but that's only natural because my body is coarsing with adrenaline and testosterone right now. S-Sometimes my hormones get a little crazy and I get into an uncontrollable state of fight or flight.

<br><br>

So what if I kissed a guy? It's not like it's a big deal or anything. It's not my fault that I couldn't help but focus on how stupid your face looked anyways, how soft your lips are, how warm it must feel to have you in my embrace....

<br><br>

I just... I just have a lot of feelings right now, okay?! Just leave me alone already!

<br><br>

...

<br><br>

......

<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>

Do you... do you wanna get some ice cream or something?

<br><br>
